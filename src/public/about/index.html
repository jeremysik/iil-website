        <p class="fs-3">Why IsItLegit?</p>
        <p>
            One of the key features of blockchain technology is it's ability to establish consensus between participating parties without the need of trust.
            Having said this, it's kind of ironic that one of the biggest problems in the crypto space is the legitimacy of some of it's participants/projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every other day you'll hear of scammers running rampart, ripping people off then vanishing into thin air without any means of tracking them down or recovering assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had a lot of conversations with people that say that web3 will never be a thing because of these scams and bad actors.
            I refuse to believe this is a problem that we can't solve and <i>IsItLegit?</i> is my attempt to contribute to the solution.

            Hello! My name is Jeremy, I'm a Software Engineer that can't sit still and I love to build things.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated with an honours degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Canterbury (NZ).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first part of my career I worked as an Embedded Systems Engineer developing precision timing hardware for use in industrial networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after I moved to Japan. I wasn't intending on staying long but I happened to get a job at an international games publisher as a Software Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few epic years of working in Tokyo I moved to Sydney. I stayed in the software industry where I worked for a few startups including venture funded ones that had
            raised tens of millions from top investors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, in 2018 I decided to follow my passion for computer games and started an indie game studio with a colleague. For 3 years I poured all my time and
            energy into the studio, but unfortunately, it ended up not working out.
        </p>
        <p>
            That pretty much sums up my career up until the end of 2021 (if you want more details you can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremysik/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always had an eye on the crypto space but it wasn't until the beginning of 2022 where I really started to get into it.
