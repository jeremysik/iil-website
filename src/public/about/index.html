                            One of the key features of blockchain technology is it's ability to establish consensus between participating parties without the need of trust.
                            Having said this, it's kind of ironic that one of the biggest problems in the crypto space is the legitimacy of some of it's participants/projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every other day you'll hear of scammers running rampart, ripping people off then vanishing into thin air without any means of tracking them down or recovering assets.
                        </p>
                        <span>
                            I've had a lot of conversations with people that say that web3 will never be a thing because of these scams and bad actors.
                            I refuse to believe this is a problem that we can't solve and <i>IsItLegit?</i> is my attempt to contribute to the solution.

                        Jeremy is a Software Engineer that loves to build things. He graduated with an honours degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the
                        University of Canterbury (NZ). For the first couple of years of his career he worked at <a href="https://tekron.com/" target="_blank">Tekron International</a> as
                        an Embedded Systems Engineer developing precision timing hardware for use in industrial networks. He then felt the call to travel and moved to Japan for an overseas experience. 
                        He wasn't intending on staying long but happened to get a job at <a href="https://www.6waves.com/" target="_blank">6waves</a> (an international games publisher) as a Software Engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a few epic years of working in Tokyo he decided to move to Sydney. He stayed in the software industry where he worked for a few startups including venture funded ones that had raised 
                        tens of millions from top investors (<a href="https://www.4mation.com.au/" target="_blank">4Mation Technologies</a>, <a href="https://iquitsugar.com/" target="_blank">IQuitSugar</a> and 
                        <a href="https://healthengine.com.au/" target="_blank">HealthEngine</a>). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, in 2018 he decided to follow his passion for computer games and started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAqp110Doz4C44vhIrhw-w" target="_blank">Armoured Beans</a> (an indie game studio) with a colleague. For 3 years he poured all his time and
                        energy into the studio, but unfortunately, it ended up not working out.

                        He's always had an eye on the crypto space but it wasn't until the beginning of 2022 where he really started to get into it.
